# **HTTP Module - Node.js** #

- The *http module* in Node.js allows developers to create an HTTP server and handle client requests and server responses. It provides methods and properties to work with HTTP requests and responses, enabling the creation of REST API's, web pages, and other networked applications.

- A *web server* is software or hardware that serves web content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc) to clients (usually browsers) over the internet or an internet. It uses protocols like HTTP/HTTPS to handle request and responses.

# **Steps to create a server** #

*Step-1:* Importing the http Module.
- The http module is built into Node.js. Use require('http') to import it into your script.

*Step-2:* Using http.createServer().
- The createServer method initializes an HTTP server.
- It takes a callback function as an argument with two parameters.
- req: The incoming request object.
- res: the outgoing response object.

*Step-3:* Handling Requests.
- The req.url property provides the path requested by the client.
- Based on req.url, send different responses using res.end().

*Step-4:* Starting the Server.
- Use the listen() method to specify the port the server will run on.
- Optionally, pass a callback to run code when the server starts(e.g., console.log()).
